Spontaneous is still not set up.

Make edit cutoff dynamic on the day so that I can mark it as closed

do all things marked TODO

if time:
 - test javascript-less

For averaging, use score_instance_to_dict.
    Use assert to verify that it's averaging the expected fields for at least 2 (but ideally all)
    of the competitions. The nice thing about assert is that if anything changes
    then it will tell me. 
    Remember that averaging can be one of the final steps.
