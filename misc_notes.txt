TEST MORE WHAT I JUST CHANGED, then commit.

Put jquery slider BOUND TO SELECT because it gives both options (slider or select)
I'm pretty sure that the way they do it
 ( https://jqueryui.com/slider/#hotelrooms )
would gracefully degrade. Now that I have NoScript, I can test it. Everything else that I've done so far degraded gracefully.

----------- should be ready for video at this point. ----------------

add 'view old submissions' for spontaneous.

See if I need to add anything else to make spont work.

put actual rubrics in.

do all things marked TODO

Make edit cutoff dynamic on the day so that I can mark it as closed



if time:
 - test javascript-less
 - test on iphone and a few androids
 - (not very important) Just before competition - make sure team ids and names are good

For averaging, use score_instance_to_dict to get relevant fields.
    Use assert to verify that it's averaging the expected fields for at least 2 (but ideally all)
    of the competitions. The nice thing about assert is that if anything changes
    then it will tell me. 
    Remember that averaging can be one of the final steps.
