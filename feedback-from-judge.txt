Lucinda:
    should be a comments section because it
     was powerful even though they scored poorly.

Corey Treacy:
    - been here since 7:45, but no judging needed till 10 am
    - no refreshments offered;
        lunch was just snacks
        (not enough food / sandwiches; sandwiches were gone.)
    - no breaks (swapping out judges)
    Good: - Tony was good & helpful    
    
My thought on Corey's comment:
 Tony was perhaps spread too thin to ask for alternate judges
