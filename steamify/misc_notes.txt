I think I actually do want to change the link breadcrumbs so that it's
Score entry > Long Problem > Team ID
^^ links to score entry home
                ^^ links to team pick
in other words, shift everything back.


TODO - ideally, the numerical order of the ids should match the
alpha sorting so that 
sorted(full_team_ids) == sorted(team_ids_numerical_portion_only)




the next step is probably recording the judge username on submission.

then put actual rubrics in.
