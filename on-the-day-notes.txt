I would like another volunteer to help with misc.

Things I'll do:
 - watch the login time
 - watch the scores for multisubmit

Things the volunteer could do:
 - step them through a submission ( fake team: M.DE.999 )
 - change their password  ( optional: http://nonsense.x2d.org/ )
 - run to talk to a judge if needed
